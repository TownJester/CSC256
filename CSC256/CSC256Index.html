        <h2> Assignment Details</h2>
        <p id="details"> Create a very basic INDEX.HTML page and a very basic MAIN.CSS that shows your name, major, UAT email address, and expected graduation date (May 2025 for example). You do not need to include a photo with this assignment. This is to refresh your memory of HTML/CSS and we will build upon this webpage during this class. </p>
